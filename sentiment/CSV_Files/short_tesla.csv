Reality is that it is stupid and impractical to have a mechanical engine running on gas/diesel. Even if you want to use gas to produce energy, it is much better/safe to do it at a power plant. It is much easier to optimize at large scale and then small scale(ICE). Only issue is that it is hard to carry that much energy in a very compact way. So, Elon laid out a plan to solve that exact problem. And ICE generates a lot of heat and wear and tear for the vehicle.
