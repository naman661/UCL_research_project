Now,Today just because someone else who is younger has developed a cool does not mean they are doing anything illegal. In fact, It is absolutely brilliant and if i would of developed this 10 years ago i would have zero shame implementing it. For a brokerage to silence them because they are kicking Hedge Funds in the Ass is a shame and I just hope that these traders dont back down. They should Sue the shit out of anyone that stands in their way.Nothing is illegal.Robin Hood must be boycotted by anyone, especially those in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s who they are supposed to represent.

Just an update.  Resurrected Elvis, after 4 fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches ( thank YOU for the supplies ), finally got his nap and rest from about 1:30 AM to 7:30 AM ( you don&#39;t need so much when you are 25 years old) is awake and ready to trade too. 

He said that after his premature departure, it felt like he was just released from this place, you know, that place where THE REAL criminals ( We are watching you SEC ) in the world are supposed to go to.  Elvis also said that no one better try and step on his blue suede shoes and that these inside traders at CNBC have some really suspicious minds and are acting like a pack of butt hurt hound dogs.  

What is that Elvis?  If your fans really love you they will what?
Oh, okay you really feel a burning love about this don&#39;t you...

Jan. 26, 2021 12:04 PMFisker Inc. (FSR)MGA, NIO, TSLAFisker&#39;s current sub-$5 billion fully diluted valuation signals it is trading at a deep discount to EV peers.
Fisker has logged over 10,550 reservations for the Ocean, its five-person, ESG-focused true midsize SUV.
Ocean&#39;s competitive pricing stemming from leveraging Magna&#39;s manufacturing capabilities, with an estimated 250k unit volume in 2025.

operates in UK, Italy, USA and The Netherlands with operational plants
1. Long term contracts with all country energy companies
2. It received  151.000.000 Euro from NL government and loan by BANK local Government 
3. Commitment Invest NL minister of Economy, Finanance
4. Locally lot of information on the plant in The Netherlands available, supporting 24.000 Households per year only with this plant
5. Corporate holds 100% local entities
6. Filed and approved by SEC to go Dark for a while. This is a saving of 500K per year which they used for getting in control and accelerate
7. Operational manager at Chijnsgoed Parkmanagement BV. confirmed Sterksel operational for 24.000 households and biggest 100% green energy provider in The Netherlands

"@International_Mom  The typical drop off post lock-up is 1-3%, but a few things to consider: 1.  Earnings beat or miss? Likely it will be a beat or meet the expectations of WS given guidance.   2.

The question then becomes: when is the party over?  If $TSLA is an example, the party never seems to end lol.

"$GME Elon Musk Says Discord Gone &#39;Corpo&#39; After It Takes Down WallStreetBets
10:47 pm ET January 27, 2021 (Benzinga) Print
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: $TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk expressed his disappointment with Discord after the platform took down WallStreetBets from its platform.

What Happened: “Even Discord has gone corpo …,” the world’s richest person said in a tweet late Wednesday.

Discord had taken down WallStreetBets earlier in the evening, saying the community continued to allow hateful and discriminatory content despite repeated warnings.

The company said the action didn’t have any relation to WallStreetBets’ role in the surge of GameStop Corp.’s (NYSE: $GME ) stock.

WallStreetBets moderators described the Discord action as “pretty unethical.”

“I am not impressed with them destroying our community instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts,” one of the group moderators said.

No drinking directly from the refrigerator milk jug or carton!

Well, he worked swing shift and one morning I came downstairs to find my dear ole dad, refrigerator door open,  in his underwear,  tilting that golden jug back and chugging away.

Needless to say, I was a bit shocked.

I just thought that the rule applied to him too.

I forgot, HE bought the milk!

I called him out and loudly said ( he had a good sense of humor )...

Why you old jug sucker you!

We laughed at this.  He agreed that he shouldn&#39;t do the deed.

Feds are not responsible for any bubbles. We have three bubbles happening at the same time. This never happened before but here we are. There is a housing bubble due to all-time low rates. There is a corporate debt bubble because the companies taking loans can never pay back the loans they are taking, and we have a market bubble due to the trillions of dollars the feds have been pumping in the market. There has never been three bubbles about to burst at the same time till now. When one bursts the other two will follow, or they can all burst at the same time.

"Why did Gamestop&#39;s action skyrocket?

It is impossible to detect a single culprit for the start of the wave, but it is a fact that the Reddit group &#39;r / WallStreetBets&#39; had an important participation. After discovering that there were large investment funds and analysts betting heavily on the fall of Gamestop&#39;s shares, group participants decided to encourage a coordinated (strong high) pump in the action.
Coordination of ‘pump and dump’ is very common, although prohibited. However, when using VPN to hide traces, it is common to find dedicated groups on Telegram, Reddit and other social networks. 

The Melvin Capital crash
One of those investment funds that bet on the fall of Gamestop was Melvin Capital, a company that managed no less than $ 12.5 billion. To save the manager from the big losses, even bigger investment firms injected capital into the company, a total of $ 2.75 billion. Moral of the story: don&#39;t bet against millennials!

TSLA posts Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.80 vs. $0.41 (+95.1%), $0.25 short of consensus. The miss was driven by weaker-than-expected margins, as revenue rose 45.5% to $10.74B ($290M above consensus). TSLA did not provide 2021 vehicle sales guidance, aside from saying it expects full-year sales to exceed its longer-term annual growth target of 50%. We think this statement is likely to be viewed negatively, as it implies 2021 vehicle sales north of 750K units (the current consensus is 796K). However, TSLA stated that its current installed production capacity is 1.05M units and we think CEO Elon Musk probably chose to be less specific given various uncertainties. We remain at a Hold, but view TSLA&#39;s cost of capital advantage relative to other automakers as enviable",Bullish,Bullish,0.4497

So where does that leave us? I&#39;ve been an advocate of buying big dips. And now? Too early to tell. There is likely more downside but I will once again defer to my two sentiment indicators- TSLA and Bitcoin. If TSLA holds above $800 and Bitcoin remains above 30,000, then yeah, im buying pullbacks. As for STPK, which I&#39;ve been building a position in, boy did today reek of a large margin call or an exit to cover another position (Citron?) But that&#39;s a good thing.

"$BNGO QUICK UPDATE ON THE SITUATION

we all bought into BNGO because of its huge potential in the market - it has NO FDA APPROVAL, NO ARK INVEST, and it still performs outstanding, because of the products they have and their fundamentals!

the slight dip today is nothing to worry about - it is solely because of the WSB action going on, by Friday AH or monday PRE, we will see this back to something we can call a &quot;normal state&quot; 

2 important things have just happended today/yesterday

1. ARKG mentioned BNGO in their portfolio for the first time, this is a gamechanger and would have sky rocketed the stock on a usual day
BUT WE WAIT

2. one of the chiefs just announced an amazing update covering the possible use of Saphyr for Cancer! GAME CHANGER

Absolutely.  It’s a bubble and everyone (should) know it’s a bubble.  Entry and exit are key.  I sold my $TSLA at $314 (pre split- so that would be more than 10x now) because I thought that was a bubble, and it’s still a bubble.

At the end of the day, the Federal Reserve is to blame for the liquidity-driven bubbles they’ve allowed to form in the markets.  They could print and raise interest rates, or keep rates low and not print, but their current trajectory is literally the most reckless thing I’ve ever seen and I used to be a career bartender.

"&quot;Shorts at risk of losing millions&quot;

Many traders have recently been synchronizing their purchases on sites like Twitter and Reddit in an attempt to drive up the price of heavily shorted stocks.
A so-called short squeeze occurs when short-sellers -- people who have placed bets that would profit from a decline in a stock&#39;s price -- are forced to close their positions to stem their losses. To do so, short-sellers must buy back the shares they sold short. When done en masse, this type of forced selling on the part of short-sellers can lead to a quick and violent rise in a stock&#39;s price.

Well well well. Look what we have here? 
Plug pays a negative price for a capital raise just like Tesla. It‘s super growth. And super Growth is capital intensive. And I like how Andy‘s allocated his cash so far. He knows how to perfectly plant his seeds for hyper growth. In the Business Update Call yesterday Andy mentioned that most times they say no to potential JVs or proposed acquisitions. He only invests in markets with huge upscaling potential. 
And for that Plug needs that cash.  
Imagine how many Gigafactories they can build with that kind of money.

Investor anxiety mounts over prospect of stock market ‘bubble’

Veteran managers warn over exuberance as stock valuations and other signals flash red 🚦

Do you have a plan — what will do to protect you gains ?   This is the question — do you understand which companies are first in the fire-line it if all all goes wrong.   

Alpine 4 is tomorrow’s growth stock, so my personal educated opinion would be that your gains should be protected by investing in a holding company with prospects like A4.

What you don’t want to happen is being caught of guard 💂‍♀️ with equites owned in larger companies like $FB $GOOGL or $TSLA alone.

There is carnage today on the broader market, and many of us has long been waiting for the ‘bubble’ created — to start showing signs of the trouble. 

Listen guys — I also own equities in the likes of $AMZN $TSLA &amp; $AAPL but things could turn ugly and when it does, it does so quickly.  

It could perhaps be wise to look at smaller value equities in order to protect your gains.  

‘Some point to the explosion in trading by inexperienced amateurs as a particular concern. 

These investors, seen as flighty “weak hands” by professional fund managers, intolerant of losses and quick to exit bets, have been on the ascendancy as lockdown boredom encouraged them to the commission-free trading offered by start-ups like Robinhood”

This was just a ton of retail with trading apps on their phones deciding on Reddit to push the big boys out.

"$TSLA Love Is Blind: The Truths Behind Marketing Of Tesla, Regional Engineering And Connected Cars. 
 
In “The Truman Show”, the director is asked why he thinks the protagonist of the global-hit reality TV show,, has never discovered the truth of his entirely-fabricated world. His response is the most poignant statement on the 1990’s and, in fact, could summarize the issues our world is presently experiencing with social media, phony politicians and fake news: “We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. 
Automotive is no stranger to an alter-reality. Rather than an omnipotent director, though, the purveyors of untruths are individual, masterful, marketing departments or stock analysts with quick soundbytes. But just like Truman, we should examine the data, question the boundaries of truth, and hopefully prove ignorance is not always bliss.  
Be like Truman Burbank. Poke at the facade. Look for alternate data. Find the truth...

"$TSLA JPMorgan: &#39;Remain highly cautious on valuation&#39;. 
 
Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes today. Even the smallest of misses could weigh on the company&#39;s extreme valuation. 
Tesla&#39;s shares surged in 2020 as steady profitability, retail-investor demand, and encouraging analyst upgrades boosted bullishness. Tesla now trades with a trailing P/E of more than 1,600x, making it among the most highly valued stocks in the world.  
While 2020 saw many analysts come around on Tesla and reverse their bearish outlooks, JPMorgan remains skeptical.  
Despite the stock&#39;s overwhelmingly bullish trend, investors should &quot;remain highly cautious on valuation,&quot; the bank said in a Friday note. JPMorgan&#39;s recently lifted price target of $125 implies a roughly 85% plunge over the next 12 months. 
Taking 2023 estimates into account lifts the bank&#39;s target slightly, but elements of the model still suggest shares are flying too close to the sun.

The Renault Zoe overtook the Tesla Model 3 to become the best-selling BEV in Europe in 2020. With the total 1.42 million cars sold, representing a 147% yoy increase, EV accounted for 12% of all cars sold across 23 European markets. 
The Renault Zoe led the sales with 99,261 units sold in 2020 a 118% yoy increase. Tesla sold 85,713 Model 3, representing a 9% yoy fall. 
The VW ID 3 was third with 56,118 units sold, despite only going on sale in the middle of last year. 
Notably,  the ID 3 was the second best-selling car in December, with 27,997 models sold during the month. It was beaten by only the VW Golf, which sold 30,073. 
The VW Group’s success meant it passed Tesla to become Europe’s biggest EV manufacturer, with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance also moving up to second. While Tesla accounted for 31% of all EV sales in 2019, its 13.3% market share in 2020 was only the third highest.

For this, they will need considerably mire lithium since the solid state’s battery&#39;s negative terminal, called its anode, is made from pure lithium metal.

"$TSLA  I multiplied amount of cars that Tesla sold under 500,000. This number times an average of $45,000 per vehicle. This adds up to 22.5 billion. Then I check to see how much their other products on the average sold. Other than vehicles and vehicle leases their sales are approximatly 5% in the energy business. So if you take and even add 10% of their gross sales for the year should be under $25 billion. That&#39;s gross total for the year.  
 
 As far as net Tesla will be lucky to net $4 billion for the year.  
That&#39;s net not gross. You guys probably don&#39;t know there&#39;s a difference.  
 The more other companies are making EV&#39;s the less regulatory credits Tesla will be getting.  I&#39;m sure whatever we see their accounting will be very creative IMO.

"@ellerk88 @BluntTrauma I don&#39;t disagree. I think the total possible outstanding shares (including warrants) if the deal is fully subscribed would be 149m. While that doubles the current float, the future potential to build a better business with the $41 million in cash outweighs the dilution. The drone industry is in its infancy and this company is well connected, with great third-party validation and a lot of software and IP to leverage. The dilution may sting a little, yes, but raising cash now is going to yield multiples in return over the coming year/years. Both traders and long-term investors should be happy to see this cash coming in. There is a long road ahead for Draganfly. When $TSLA raise $5 billion recently, the stock blipped down momentarily then soared. While Draganfly and Tesla are two different companies, they both have reasons and need to invest in technologies for the future. IMO that is why cash raises for certain companies, despite dilution, should be rewarded.",,Bullish,0.9653

Unlike other companies in the same field — ABML has claimed a &quot;closed loop&quot; process that basically recycles much of the reagents and water used in the recycling process.

What makes ABML stand out is that its team is used to high volume processes while at $TSLA  — they&#39;re designing battery recycling to be done at a high volume with high efficiency.

&gt; The current federal vehicle fleet is estimated at around 645,000 vehicles, and President Biden plans to replace all of them with American-made electric vehicles. The American-made part of this is essential because the announcement was part of Biden&#39;s &quot;Made In America&quot; executive order, which is set to redirect a sizable portion of the government&#39;s spending to American businesses and on American-made products.",,Bullish,0.4854

"$TSLA My calculations and charting indicates the following:
1. Around 2:40 PM is when the bull push begins.
2. The push will go up around $10-11 which means we will hit 900-901.
3. I will bounce there and go down $5-10 (890 low or 895 high)
4. Around 3:35 we will have a bull rush back over 900 to reach 910 high with around 908 by EOD at 4 PM.

How I got this is based off yesterday&#39;s patterns and how that market worked.  Closing above 900 is a psyche change.  This will signal what I believe is a Bullish charge tomorrow on Earning Day from pre-market to go up to 930 or higher.  The Bulls will follow this to 960 or higher.

Ryan has a list of his patents - Ryan Melsert Inventions, Patents and Patent Applications - Justia Patents.

When he joined he also brought along August Meng (PhD, ex-Tesla) with him, Chuck Leber (construction manager for Tesla&#39;s Nevada Gigafactory), and now more recently ex-Tesla Kris Gustafson to lead procurement. 

The entire team is basically ex-Tesla. Their COO is also ex- $FB

The higher float versions usually take a little longer (weeks, not days), but if I sat here long enough -- I&#39;m positive I could come up with at least one example -- per year -- that went from UNDER 10 to over 100 in a single day, and with high float metrics.  

These moves (which do happen all the time) are not about capital impact.  They&#39;re about SUPPLY &amp; DEMAND.  You get enough people talking about something (DEMAND) with a very low float (SUPPLY), and you&#39;re bound to see moves like GME happen.

‘Every investor has had a knee-jerk reaction and made a decision that, in hindsight, might have not have been the best move. It may have been the result of a rapid increase or decrease in the value of a particular stock, or based on incomplete information. 

These rash decisions are typically rooted in fear and can be wealth-killers over the long run.’

‘Not everybody can be comfortable investing in high-risk, high-reward companies, which is an area where a lot of my investments are or at least they start out that way.’

I think it&#39;s important for folks to be able to sleep at night.’

I do not enjoy losing out on tomorrow’s possibilities and the NASDAQ up-list.

Tesla Inc.

In December, they gave us data showing the most orders for a one month period ever, the most deliveries for a one month period ever and I have no doubt with new stores, more capacity, etc. these numbers are only getting going.  January numbers will definitely paint a clearer picture.

"$TSLA Tesla is right now trading completely out of the realm of reality.  
  
Tesla cut prices 14 times last year. And China alone, the price of the Model 3 SR plus was down 30% over the year.  Tesla seems to have an uncanny ability recently to cut the price on its car yet report flat gross margins. 
VW is going to have 600,000 cars of capacity in China next year.   
If they&#39;re just at 50% utilization, that&#39;s double the amount of cars that Tesla sold in China in 2020.  
VW priced its highest end car below the cost of the Model 3, not the Model Y. So there&#39;s significant competition coming into China this year.  
What happened when competition came into Europe? Tesla&#39;s market share went from 30% in Q4 of &#39;19, to roughly 10% in Q4 of 2020. They lost significant share. So when competition comes in, they&#39;re losing share. And this is a company that is basically achieving profitless growth by cutting the price of their car to keep volumes flat. That&#39;s not sustainable.

"@CasinoCapital - this really isnt a big deal.

The Federal fleet is 640k vehicles, 200k of those are the USPS trucks, 200k are military and 240k are civilian agencies that could go EV.

The average age of the civilian agency vehicles is 7 years.  They aren&#39;t going to simply replace them all at once, on average they will replace a less than 40k vehicles per year.

If you add in maybe 10k DOD vehicles per year that&#39;s a grand total of 50k vehicles that could be EV sales.  That 50k vehicles split across the entire US EV sector is not that big a deal.

The 50k in sales will be sedans and pickups.  If you split them equally between $TSLA, $GM, $F and $RIDE you are not talking about too many vehicles, less than 15k per company.

The fact is that sales to the federal  government are simply not that large.  This whole announcement is simple political posturing.  The USPS contract is as many vehicles per year for a single company, it&#39;s a MUCH bigger deal!",Bullish,Bullish,0.5093

"$TSLA &#39;This is not normal&#39; - WS grows wary of stock bubbles. 
 
A flood of money supply, ultra-low or zero interest rates and COVID-19 vaccine rollouts have sparked a &quot;buy everything&quot; rally, helping world stocks add a whopping $33 trillion in value from their lows of last March. 
Surges in share prices of some loss-making firms, red-hot public markets and amateur investors chasing stocks have drawn concern as the S&amp;P 500 index has gained more than 70% since March. 
Elevated retail participation has contributed to soaring prices.  
&quot;Pockets of the market have recently demonstrated investor behavior consistent with bubble-like sentiment,&quot; GS analysts led by David Kostin wrote recently. 
For examples of these bubbles, investors point to EV-related stocks - Tesla Inc is up 8-fold and electric vehicle charging equipment maker Blink Charging by 2,000% in the last 52 weeks, while an IPO index has surged 200% since last March versus a mere 57% for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.

Biden plans to replace government fleet with electric vehicles

KEY POINTS
*   President Joe Biden plans to replace the government’s vehicle fleet with electric vehicles assembled in the U.S.
*   He announced the plan Monday when signing a new “Buy American” executive order.
*   The government is a major purchaser of vehicles. However, replacing such a fleet with EVs assembled domestically will be costly and take time.

Low float + short squeeze potential + settlement news =
 300-500% gains on news day, potentially much more - which means it would be at anywhere from $30-$50/share.

Which already gets my 🚀 blasting off pretty hard... but wait -
there&#39;s more!

At $100/share (which would be a 1400%+ increase and only assumes a $2B market cap which would make it comfortably 2nd to Botox which is at a $3.8B market cap, which it was on track to do before the lawsuit) it is a 14X BAGGER, which is where it arguably would have been within the next month or two anyway with it&#39;s insanely fast adoption by the market.

The company is involved in recycling lithium-ion batteries and on top of that, it has extensive extraction interests in the state of Nevada as well  &amp; not to far from $TSLA

 This is an Obvious dog whistle to the right wing white supremacist&#39;s.

The order was said to be made in an effort to  fight Covid 19 but we know it was a thinly veiled attack on Muslims and Minorities. We must rise up against this tyranny.

Seriously? Biden Won the election? Damn it. So... The whole Buy America thing and Travel Ban was all just done by President Biden?  What the hell am I supposed to write now?

People are slowly but surely staring to pick up on this operation.  The news are stating to filter through.   

It’s perhaps an OTC at the moment, but this company will become one of the biggest players in the EV sector.  

If you are not buying here, you could very well forever regret not taking a stake or selling what you had.  

The buzz surrounding the company is making the rounds — from a couple of 100 viewers to nearly 20 000 in just over month on this forum alone.  

Don’t let tomorrow’s opportunities pass you by. 

The EV sector desperately needs this operation to be a success.

• The cost of solar has dropped by 90% over the last two decades, making it the cheapest form of new power generation in markets including Spain, Italy, India and 16 U.S. states, and the list of countries where solar will become dominant over the next decade will increase to include every U.S. state as well as Canada, China and 14 other countries, the report says.
• &quot;The cost decline trend is not slowing down any time soon,&quot; says Wood Mackenzie head of solar research Ravi Manghani. &quot;Yes, there are some externalities that may change, on a short-term basis, but the level of innovation we&#39;ve seen in the industry makes us feel good about the cost reduction possibilities that exist.&quot;",,Bullish,0.886

Ever so often you get an opportunity like today, with the Senate laying forth its plan for impeachment and its negative impact on the markets. Expert traders render themselves more efficient as they consider not only stock market forces whereby a stock spikes and sheds naturally or because of information specific to the company, but especially outside forces which impact all stocks, good or bad. Those of you that rely on astrologically inclined charts to predict the direction of a stock when the truth is it only tells you where the stock has been, and without any consideration for what is happening out in the &#39;real&#39; world, are simply detached from reality.

It’s developed by Stanford graduates to be the first coin app you can mine from your phone. It’s not BS and it’s not a scam. Look it up before you even download it.

Considering that nearly three million trucks were sold in North America last year, it figures that electric trucks will be a big deal. The Cox Automotive Consumer Snapshot study revealed that close to 2-in-5 consumers intending to buy a truck over the next two years would consider an electric pickup.  
The electric Ford F-150 came out on top with 59 percent of consumers considering it appealing, followed by 41 percent for the GMC Hummer EV. Surprisingly, the Tesla Cybertruck was only found to be appealing by 19 percent of respondents.

"$TSLA Waymo CEO Believes Tesla&#39;s AutoPilot Is Not Self Driving Rival. 
 
J. Krafcik has reiterated that Tesla&#39;s autopilot technology isn&#39;t a rival to Waimo&#39;s autopilot but rather characterised it as an Advanced Driver Sssistance feature. 
&quot;It is a misconception that you can just keep developing an ADS until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,&quot; Krafcik said. &quot;In terms of robustness and accuracy our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers&quot; Krafcik argues.  
Tesla&#39;s autopilot technology has been notorious for various accidents where users have shown a tendency to depend on it fully and have not paid attention to the road moved their hands away from the wheel. 
Musk has repeatedly been saying that Tesla will deliver full autonomous technology since 2018, but is yet to deliver. 
Krafcik revealed that Waymo&#39;s original plan was the same as Tesla&#39;s but the strategy was rejected years ago.

BERLIN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Germany&#39;s motor vehicle authority (KBA) is looking into safety risks related to touchscreen displays in Tesla TSLA.O cars and has asked the U.S. auto maker to provide information following a similar request by U.S. authorities, a KBA spokesman was quoted as saying. 
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday asked Tesla to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over media control unit (MCU) failures that could pose safety risks by leading to touchscreen displays not working. 
A KBA spokesman told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that German authorities were in contact with the NHTSA and that the KBA had launched its own investigation. 
&quot;The result of the review is still pending,&quot; the spokesman added.

$TSLA - Reports earnings on Wednesday with the rest of the high flying stocks (AAPL, FB, LRCX). I’m expecting a beat on earnings but am more curious about the outlook of 2021. These are the following topics I want to be brought up during the call and answered by Elon Musk and his team. 
Their progress on the 4680 battery cells 
Updates on the potential refresh of the Model S and Model X 
Updates on the Gigapress they just received in Fremont and Texas
 2021 estimates for the number of cars delivered (Personally I’m expecting 750-800k) 

Three projections for the stock price after their earnings call. 1. Tesla breaks ATHs once again. 2. Tesla trades sideways with the price fluctuating 1-2%. 3. Tesla sells off and hits 815 (lowest 775).",Bullish,Bullish,0.6798

$TSLA So we are all here for the money right!? For potential long term investment without spending any money or giving any of your info out other than your name.....download “pi network” app and start mining ASAP. It’s in start up phase just like bitcoin was in 2008. Currently pi coins have no value (just like bitcoin did). It’s developed by Stanford graduates to be the first coin app you can mine from your phone. It’s not BS and it’s not a scam. Look it up before you even download it. Reason I’m spreading the work is cuz the more miners we get.....the greater it improves the chances of them being successful and they’re already releasing they’re wallet before the end of 2021. Over 10 million users already. Use referral code “Edvardgh92” to get started once you download the app with some free pi coin and to earn pi coin faster!!!!!!!!!!,,Bullish,0.971

What we know is basically revenues from their deliveries for the quarter applying discounts handed out over the quarter to a weighted avg of 6% lower prices they got then previous quarter. We know their cash on hand will be strong with recent offering and CAPEX spending to take a big spike. We know not to expect any surprise revenues from solar panels as that is very flat niche right now for them. We also know the insurance side hasnt generated any. So the only place i can see a surprise is if they were able to claim even more ZEV credits than before. 2 recalls wont help margins as well.

"$NPA $TSLA 
So I just read that the US will have 80% of the population covered by 5g at the end of 2021. Which leaves roughly 60 Million people not covered. Another point is that only 12% of phones are 5g compatible and being used in the US by the end of 2021. The adoption rate of 5g globally will be at a much higher rate around the time we get things set up globally in 2024. 5G usage rates are very low and will be for the next couple of years. The mobile VR and other applications just are not there yet. The cart is diffidently in front of the horse. But going back to my main point those 60 million people in the US can possibly net us $5 each a month or 
$300M
 a month or 3.6B a year. This doesn&#39;t include all the industrial applications for our technology. Connecting Cars will be big and star link will only connect Tesla vehicles eventually Musk will get it. While we can go after Ford, GM Toyota and everyone else. There is no way we don&#39;t get

Anywho, I&#39;ve been enjoying some of the comments on this thread regarding the upcoming $1B expected ER.  I, like many others feel the stock market is gravely overvalued at dangerous levels in comparison to the overall economy.  Are we in a bubble?  Absolutely!  But we&#39;ve known this for at least eight weeks now.  We&#39;ve been hitting record highs since the end of the October/November pullback.  Will we keep going?  I don&#39;t know.  What I do know is we are in an extremely expensive place (so what with the free cash flow analysis) and the market needs a pricing correction and a reality check.  Yes, the fed propping, blah blah, but if you haven&#39;t seen inflation already at the grocery store, you must be blind.  Until the market&#39;s conscious shows up (HA!), carry on.
