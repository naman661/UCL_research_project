"$MNMD this will do to mental health and pharmaceutical industry what $SHOP and $AMZN  did to retail industry and what $TSLA is doing to power and transportation and the list can go on and onâ€¦. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m okay with the steps weâ€™re in today with this company. The baby stages. Great things take time. Let the day trader penny flip. Itâ€™s okay itâ€™s part of the game. If you want to park your cash somewhere safe where it will grow. Youâ€™re in the right place. More importantly the cause; youâ€™ll be supporting your neighbor who suffers from mental health issues on a daily basis with no idea how to handle it. In the near future, just like weâ€™re saying changes in education and transportation and online retail and all sorts of thingsâ€¦. We will also see changes in the way we treat mental concerns.

"$KCAC There are only 2 LIMITING FACTORS to all EV&#39;s:

1. SOFTWARE
2. POWER SOURCE

With that in mind....... $TSLA needs to field in more VEHICLES in real roads with real PEOPLE so it can gather more data for its SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. That is the primary reason why ELON MUSK is coming up with a VERY AFFORDABLE CAR (Approx $22,000).

It has been proven time and time again that the current power source of ALL EV&#39;s (NIO, XPENG, VW, BHD, Toyota, Mercedes Benz, NIKOLA and etc) is TOO LIMITING

$KCAC made ELON MUSK jump from his seat and personally VISIT VW.
